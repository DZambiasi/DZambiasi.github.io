## About

I am an economist working on the economics of crime and institutional enforcement.  
My research examines how political incentives, institutional signals, and enforcement strategies shape criminal behaviour, compliance, and discrimination.

I study the rules of the game, who breaks them, and how enforcement institutions respond.
